Fall sideways while walking forward1
In the living room, a person walks toward a box and grabs it. The person walks in the living room, bringing a box. The person wants to place the box near the sofa area. That's why the person walks over to the sofa. Then, the person falls on the floor due to incorrect weight shifting while walking forward. Establishing a narrow support base while stepping around the box can contribute to a sideways fall. The base of support refers to the area formed by the contact points between a person's feet and the ground. When the base of support is narrow, it reduces stability and makes it easier to lose balance.
