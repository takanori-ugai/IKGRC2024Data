Walk with memory loss8
After getting up from the bed, a person walks toward the bathroom for personal hygiene by passing kitchen and livingroom. However, a person is in trouble remembering why and where he/she walks due to the symptoms of memory loss. Thus, in the bathroom, the person walks to one place to other places repeatedly without performing other actions.
