Clean sink3
The person walks into the bathroom and directed their attention towards the sink. Realizing it needed cleaning, he/she decides to find suitable cleaning materials. The person looks around and located the cleaning supplies, grabbing them to prepare for the task of cleaning the sink and its countertop. With the cleaning materials in hand, the person walks over to the sink. The person starts by using the cleaning material to wipe down the sink, ensuring that he/she cover all the surfaces and removed any dirt or grime. After thoroughly cleaning the sink, the person proceeds to grab the small items that required cleaning, such as the soap tray and toothpaste cup, etc. The person takes these items and scrubbed them using the cleaning materials, making sure to remove any residue or build-up. Once cleaned, place the items back onto the countertop, arranging them neatly. To complete the cleaning process, the person goes back to the sink and wiped it down once again with the cleaning material. This final wipe ensured that any remaining dirt or cleaning solution was removed, leaving the sink and countertop looking fresh and clean. Satisfied with the cleanliness of the sink and its surrounding area, the person steps back and admired/looked at his/her work, knowing that the bathroom now had a sparkling and well-maintained sink.
