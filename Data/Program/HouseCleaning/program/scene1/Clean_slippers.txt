Clean slippers
Slippers may spend more time on feet than any other footwear, so regular cleaning is required. Thus, a person in a bedroom walks towards the slippers and picks them up. Then, the person shakes the slippers and brings them into a bathroom to wash. The person walks over to the sink and finds the faucet. Switch on the tap to fill the sink with warm water. Switch off the faucet. Then, the person enters the kitchen to find a handwashing or mild detergent. On the way from the bathroom to the kitchen, he/she must pass through the bedroom. Afterward, the person re-enters the bathroom and pours detergent into the sink to make soapy water. Drop the slippers into the sink and use the personâ€™s fingers to scrub the inside lining to penetrate the grime. After the slippers have soaked, go ahead and let the water out of the sink. Turn on the faucet to refill the sink with clean water to rinse them. The person rinses the slippers under the running tap for two or three minutes to remove the soap. Then, grab the slippers and put them on the floor to let them dry.
