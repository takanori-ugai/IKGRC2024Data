Stretch and warm up the legs as they will be primarily involved in performing the straddle splits. After that, position the feet shoulder-width apart, and bend at the knees while raising arms. Thighs and arms should be parallel to the floor. Keep the back of the body straight and avoid extending the knees past the toes.
