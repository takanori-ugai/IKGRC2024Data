Use bathroom1
As soon as I get up in the early morning. I walk outside of the bedroom to use the bathroom. To reach bathroom, he/she needs to pass kitchen. Looks at the toilet in the bathroom. Open the toilet lid and sit on it. Flush the toilet and stand up. Close the toilet lid. Walk towards the faucet. Turn on the faucet and hold my hands underneath the stream of water to wet them or apply enough hand soap to cover my hands. Soap and scrub up my hands. Then rinse under the running water of the faucet to remove all the soap from my hands. If the water does not automatically shut off, turn off the faucet. Go to the bathroom at the sink, grab toothbrush and toothpaste. Squeeze a pea-sized amount of toothpaste on toothbrush, put back toothpaste. Gently brush with a short motion on surfaces of the teeth. After brushing the teeth, hold the toothbrush under running water for a few seconds to remove any bacteria from the brush. Rinsing also removes any leftover toothpaste. Place the toothbrush somewhere where it will readily dry out. Otherwise, bacteria can grow. If you choose to rinse mouth after brushing, take a sip of water from a disposable cup, or cup your hands under the faucet. Drink or swish it around your mouth and spit it out.
